### Functions - Reusable blocks of code ###

Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece
of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code
whenever you need it using a single short command - rather than having to type out
the same code multiple times.

## Where do I find functions? ###

In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. Now it's time to start really
exploring the syntax of functions.

Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of
brackets - () - and you're not using a common built-in language structure like a
for loop, while or do...while loop or if...else statement, you are using a functinon.

## Built-in browser functions ##

We've used functions built in to the browser a lot in this course.

Every time we manupulated a text string ,for example:

const myText = "I am a string";
const newString = myText.replace("string", "sausage");
console.log(newString);
// the replace() string function takes a source string,
// and a target string and replaces the source string,
// with the target string, and returns the newly formed string

We were using a function!
